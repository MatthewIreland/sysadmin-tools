Walkthroughs
============

A series of guides primarily written for my own benefit. I'm terrible at remembering step-by-step procedures and it can be awfully tedious when I can't do something, having done it many times before. Having said that, if other people benefit from what's here as well, then that's awesome.

Currently contains:
* IRC setup (irc_setup.md)
