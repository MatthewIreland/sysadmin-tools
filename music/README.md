sysadmin-tools -- music
=======================

This is where I intend to put some scripts for managing (and perhaps streaming) my music collection.

gen-playlist.pl
---------------
TODO: Script that reads in a textfile of track names (and optionally a base directory to use if unspecified) and creates a directory of symlinks (and ./play script, that just says something like vlc *.wav) that can be used for playing the tracks.
